== Best Practices

=== F.I.R.S.T Principles
1. F - Fast
2. I - Independent
3. R - Repeatable
4. S - Self Validating
5. T - Timely
// check if I can merge it with RITE

=== Spring Boot Testing the R.I.T.E way
. Readable
. Isolated or Integrated
. Thorough
. Explicit

=== Isolate functionality
Isolate the functionality to be tested by limiting the context of loaded frameworks/components.

Often times, it is sufficient to use jUnit without loading any additional frameworks.

=== Only load slices of functionality
Try to avoid loading the entire application context
