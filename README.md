# Testing in Spring Boot

This is a workshop/presentation I gave a couple of times. 

The presentation covers the following topics:
- Testing Strategies for micro servcies (Martin Fowler)
- Spring Boot and slicing
- How to implement: unit, component, integration, and contract tests
- Testing Pyramid
